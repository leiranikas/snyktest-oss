# utm-playground

The UTM Playground is a demo web application to experiment with UTMs and the automation that can be driven by their use.
The goal of this app is to provide Marketing Operations with a place where they can experiment with UTMs independently.

## How to run the app
The app is hosted in Snyk's Heroku Enterprise account (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/snyk-utm-playground)
Changes made to this project and committed to the `Master` branch are automatically deployed to Heroku and immediately available on https://utm-playground.snyk-mops.com/

## Disclaimers and rules
1. The app requires a @snyk.io login (implemented with Google oAuth). Any content added to this app must be behind the login and not made public without approval from the Security team
2. This app is intended for experimentation only, and should not be used to host any production activities
3. Any code to be deployed to the Master Branch, must be code reviewed. Pull requests are mandatory in order to deploy code

## Coming Soon
- CI pipeline with CircleCI for testing and build activities before deploy
- Separate branch for production deployment to prevent changes from being deployed without review, test and build
